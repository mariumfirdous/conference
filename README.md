#Conference

##Introduction
My first java program, this program helps in scheduling session for a conference with one of the session and the lunch time was fixed.

##Technologies
•	Java

##Setup
You just need a java compiler. Once you take the code and run , it will give the output of all the scheduled session with timings.

##Assumptions
•	The input was fixed.
•	There is no break between sessions.
•	Networking session is for 1 hour(60min). 

##Scope of improvements
•	Input can be dynamic.
•	It can be broken into smaller classes like adding class for session, track, etc to make it more modular.
•	Timings can be converted to 12hour format.
•	Can create a seperate function for displaying.
